[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is an open-source VPN solution written in C by [Jason Donenfeld](https://www.jasondonenfeld.com/) and [others](https://github.com/WireGuard/WireGuard/graphs/contributors), aiming to fix many of the problems that have plagued other modern server-to-server VPN offerings like IPSec/IKEv2, OpenVPN, or L2TP. It shares some similarities with other modern VPN offerings like [Tinc](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/) and [MeshBird](https://github.com/meshbird/meshbird), namely good cipher suites and minimal config. As of 2020-01 [it's been merged into the 5.6 version of the Linux kernel](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/linus-torvalds-pulled-wireguard-vpn-into-the-5-6-kernel-source-tree/), meaning it will ship with most Linux systems out-of-the-box.

## Intro

Whether living behind the Great Wall of China or just trying to form a network between your servers, WireGuard is a great option and serves as a "lego block" for building networks (much in the same way that ZFS is a lego block for building filesystems).

## WireGuard Overview

- minimal config, low tunable surface area and sane defaults
- minimal key management work needed, just 1 public & 1 private key per host
- behaves like a normal network interface, behaves well with standard kernel packet routing rules
- ability to easily create a LAN like 192.0.2.0/24 between all servers, or more complex networks using custom routes
- ability to route some traffic or all traffic to/through arbitrary hosts on the VPN LAN
- robust automatic reconnects after reboots / network downtime / NAT connection table drops
- fast (low latency and line-rate bandwidth)
- modern encryption, secure by default with forward secrecy & resilience to downgrade attacks
- supports normal IP traffic, including ICMP, not just TCP/HTTP
- ability to join the VPN from Ubuntu, FreeBSD, iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, and some Chromebooks (via apps or native clients)
- supports both running on the host routing traffic for docker or running in a docker container routing for the host

**Things WireGuard does not do:**

- form a self-healing mesh network where nodes automatically gossip with neighbors
- include its own signalling/discovery layer for double-NAT traversal (WebRTC-style)
- handle automatically distributing & revoking keys through a central authority
- allow sending raw layer-2 ethernet frames (it's at the IP layer)

But you can write your own solutions for these problems using WireGuard under the hood (like [Tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) or [AltheaNet](https://althea.net/)).

## List of Other VPN Solutions

- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)
- [IPSec (IKEv2)](https://github.com/jawj/IKEv2-setup) /strongSwan: in my experience, there was lots of brittle config that was different for each OS, the NAT busting setup is very manual and involves updating the central server and starting all the others in the correct order, it wasn't great at becoming stable again after network downtime, had to be manually restarted often. your mileage may vary.
- [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/site-to-site-routing-explained-in-detail/): can work over UDP or be disguised as HTTPS traffic over TCP
- StealthVPN: haven't tried it, should I?
- [DsVPN](https://github.com/jedisct1/dsvpn): I think it does TCP-over-TCP which usually doesn't end well...
- [SoftEther](https://www.softether.org/) ([SSTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Tunneling_Protocol)): haven't tried it yet, should I? (also does TCP-over-TCP?)
- L2TP: somewhat outdated
- PPTP: ancient, inflexible, insecure, doesn't solve all the requirements
- SOCKS/SSH: good for proxying single-port traffic, not a full networking tunnel or VPN

### Mesh VPN Solutions

- [TINC](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/): haven't tried it yet, but it doesn't work on iOS, worst case scenario I could live
- [VPNCloud](https://github.com/dswd/vpncloud): similar properties to WireGuard, with more auto-mesh features
- [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns): haven't tried it yet, should I?
- [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/): haven't tried it yet, should I?
- [MeshBird](https://github.com/meshbird/meshbird): "Cloud native" VPN/networking layer
- [Yggdrasil Network](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/): Yggdrasil is a self-arranging IPv4/IPv6 mesh VPN (haven't tried it yet)

## Glossary

### Example Strings

These are demo hostnames, domain names, IP addresses, and ranges used in the documentation and example configs. Replace them with your preferred values when doing your own setup.

- Example domain: `example-vpn.dev` can be replaced with any publicly accessible domain you control
- Example hostnames: `public-server1`, `public-server2`, `home-server`, `laptop`, `phone` can be changed to your device hostnames
- IP addresses & ranges: `192.0.2.1/24`, `192.0.2.3`, `192.0.2.3/32`, `2001:DB8::/64` can be replaced with your preferred subnets and addresses (e.g. `192.168.5.1/24`)

Wherever you see these strings below, they're just being used as placeholder values to illustrate an example and have no special meaning.

**Make sure to change the IP addresses in your configs!** The blocks used in these docs are reserved for example purposes by the IETF and should never be used in real network setups.

- **`192.0.2.0/24`** (TEST-NET-1) IPv4 example range [RFC5737](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737)
- **`2001:DB8::/32`** IPv6 example range [RFC3849](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849)

You can use any private range you want for your own setups, e.g. `10.0.44.0/24`, just make sure they don't conflict with any of the LAN subnet ranges your peers are on.

### Peer/Node/Device

A host that connects to the VPN and registers a VPN subnet address such as `192.0.2.3` for itself. It can also optionally route traffic for more than its own address(es) by specifying subnet ranges in comma-separated CIDR notation.

### Bounce Server

A publicly reachable peer/node that serves as a fallback to relay traffic for other VPN peers behind NATs. A bounce server is not a special type of server, it's a normal peer just like all the others, the only difference is that it has a public IP and has kernel-level IP forwarding turned on which allows it to bounce traffic back down the VPN to other clients.

See more: [How NAT traversal works](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/) (Tailscale uses WireGuard under the hood)

### Subnet

A group of IPs separate from the public internet, e.g. 192.0.2.1-255 or 192.168.1.1/24. Generally behind a NAT provided by a router, e.g. in office internet LAN or a home Wi-Fi network.

### CIDR Notation

A way of defining a subnet and its size with a "mask", a smaller mask = more address bits usable by the subnet & more IPs in the range. Most common ones:

- `192.0.2.1/32` (a single IP address, `192.0.2.1`) netmask = `255.255.255.255`
- `192.0.2.1/24` (256 addresses from `192.0.2.0` - `192.0.2.255`) netmask = `255.255.255.0`
- `192.0.2.1/16` (65,536 IPs from `192.0.0.0` - `192.0.255.255`) netmask = `255.255.0.0`
- `192.0.2.1/8` (16,777,216 IPs from `192.0.0.0` - `192.255.255.255`) netmask = `255.0.0.0`
- `0.0.0.0/0` (4,294,967,296 addresses from `0.0.0.0` - `255.255.255.255`) netmask = `0.0.0.0`
- IPv6 CIDR notation is also supported e.g. `2001:DB8::/64`

[Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)

To people just getting started `192.0.2.1/32` may seem like a weird and confusing way to refer to a single IP. This design is nice though because it allows peers to expose multiple IPs if needed without needing multiple notations. Just know that anywhere you see something like `192.0.2.3/32`, it really just means `192.0.2.3`.

### NAT

A subnet with private IPs provided by a router standing in front of them doing Network Address Translation, individual nodes are not publicly accessible from the internet, instead the router keeps track of outgoing connections and forwards responses to the correct internal IP (e.g. standard office networks, home Wi-Fi networks, free public Wi-Fi networks, etc)

### Public Endpoint

The publicly accessible address:port for a node, e.g. `123.124.125.126:1234` or `some.domain.tld:1234` (must be accessible via the public internet, generally can't be a private IP like `10.0.0.1` or `192.168.1.1` unless it's directly accessible using that address by other peers on the same subnet).

### Private key

A WireGuard private key for a single node, generated with: `wg genkey > example.key` (never leaves the node it's generated on)

### Public key

A WireGuard public key for a single node, generated with: `wg pubkey < example.key > example.key.pub ` (shared with other peers)

### DNS

Domain Name Server, used to resolve hostnames to IPs for VPN clients, instead of allowing DNS requests to leak outside the VPN and reveal traffic. Leaks are testable with [dnsleak.com](https://dnsleak.com/).

## How WireGuard Works

### How Public Relay Servers Work

Public relays are just normal VPN peers that are able to act as an intermediate relay server between any VPN clients behind NATs, they can forward any VPN subnet traffic they receive to the correct peer at the system level (WireGuard doesn't care how this happens, it's handled by kernel IP forwarding plus whatever firewall/NAT rules your host needs).

If all peers are publicly accessible, you don't have to worry about special treatment to make one of them a relay server, it's only needed if you have any peers connecting from behind a NAT.

Each client only needs to define the publicly accessible servers/peers in its config, any traffic bound to other peers behind NATs will go to the catchall VPN subnet (e.g. `192.0.2.1/24`) in the public relays `AllowedIPs` route and will be forwarded accordingly once it hits the relay server.

In summary: only direct connections between clients should be configured, any connections that need to be bounced should not be defined as peers, as they should head to the bounce server first and be routed from there back down the VPN to the correct client.

**Important: traffic bounced through a relay server is not end-to-end encrypted between the two NAT-ed peers.** The relay server decrypts incoming traffic from one peer and re-encrypts it with the destination peer's key before forwarding. This means the relay server can see the plaintext VPN traffic passing through it. Each hop (A↔Relay, Relay↔B) is independently encrypted, but the relay acts as a trusted intermediary that performs [Cryptokey Routing](https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing) to match the decrypted packet's destination IP to the correct peer. For more details, see the [WireGuard whitepaper](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf) and [Pro Custodibus's explanation of hub-and-spoke E2EE limitations](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/12/wireguard-e2ee-hub-and-spoke/). If end-to-end encryption between NAT-ed peers is required, consider using an application-level encryption layer (e.g. TLS) on top of WireGuard, or a solution like [Tailscale's DERP relays](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works) which forward opaque encrypted packets without decrypting them.

### How WireGuard Routes Packets

More complex topologies are definitely achievable, but these are the basic routing methods used in typical WireGuard setups:

- **Direct node-to-node**  
	In the simplest case, the nodes will either be on the same LAN or both be publicly accessible. Define directly accessible nodes with hardcoded `Endpoint` addresses and ports so that WireGuard can connect straight to the open port and route UDP packets without intermediate hops.
- **Node behind local NAT to public node**  
	When 1 of the 2 parties is behind remote NAT (e.g. when a laptop behind NAT connects to `public-server2`), define the publicly accessible node with a hardcoded `Endpoint` and the NAT-ed node without. The connection will be opened from NAT client -> public client, then traffic will route directly between them in both directions as long as the connection is kept alive by outgoing `PersistentKeepalive` packets from the NAT-ed client.
- **Node behind local NAT to node behind remote NAT (via relay)**  
	Most of the time when both parties are behind NATs, the NATs do source port randomization making direct connections infeasible, so they will both have to open a connection to `public-server1`, and traffic will forward through the intermediary bounce server as long as the connections are kept alive.
- **Node behind local NAT to node behind remote NAT (via UDP NAT hole-punching)**  
	While sometimes possible, it's generally infeasible to do direct NAT-to-NAT connections on modern networks, because many NAT routers randomize source ports or otherwise restrict unsolicited return traffic. A more advanced solution needs some external signaling/discovery component to tell each side what public IP:port tuple the other side currently appears to have, and even then success still depends on the NAT behavior of both networks. This is roughly the role played by STUN/ICE-style tooling in systems like WebRTC, but plain WireGuard does not include that machinery by itself. See the full section below on [**NAT to NAT Connections**](#NAT-to-NAT-Connections) for more information.

More specific (also usually more direct) routes provided by other peers will take precedence when available, otherwise traffic will fall back to the least specific route and use the `192.0.2.1/24` catchall to forward traffic to the bounce server, where it will in turn be routed by the relay server's system routing table (`net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`) back down the VPN to the specific peer that's accepting routes for that traffic. WireGuard does not automatically find the fastest route or attempt to form direct connections between peers if not already defined, it just goes from the most specific route in `[Peers]` to least specific.

You can figure out which routing method WireGuard is using for a given address by measuring the ping times to figure out the unique length of each hop, and by inspecting the output of:

```
wg show wg0
```

### What WireGuard Traffic Looks Like

WireGuard uses encrypted UDP packets for all traffic, it does not provide guarantees around packet delivery or ordering, as that is handled by TCP connections within the encrypted tunnel.

### WireGuard Performance

WireGuard claims faster performance than most other competing VPN solutions, though the exact numbers are sometimes debated and may depend on whether hardware-level acceleration is available for certain cryptographic ciphers.

WireGuard's performance gains are achieved by handling routing at the kernel level, and by using modern cipher suites running on all cores to encrypt traffic. WireGuard also gains a significant advantage by using UDP with no delivery/ordering guarantees (compared to VPNs that run over TCP or implement their own guaranteed delivery mechanisms).

### WireGuard Security Model

WireGuard uses the following protocols and primitives to secure traffic:

- ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption, authenticated with Poly1305, using RFC7539’s AEAD construction
- Curve25519 for ECDH
- BLAKE2s for hashing and keyed hashing, described in RFC7693
- SipHash24 for hashtable keys
- HKDF for key derivation, as described in RFC5869

> WireGuard's cryptography is essentially an instantiation of Trevor Perrin's Noise framework. It's modern and, again, simple. Every other VPN option is a mess of negotiation and handshaking and complicated state machines. WireGuard is like the Signal/Axolotl of VPNs, except it's much simpler and easier to reason about (cryptographically, in this case) than double ratchet messaging protocols. It is basically the qmail of VPN software. And it's ~4000 lines of code. It is plural orders of magnitude smaller than its competitors.

### How WireGuard Manages Keys

Authentication in both directions is achieved with a simple public/private key pair for each peer. Each peer generates these keys during the setup phase, and shares only the public key with other peers.

No other certificates or pre-shared keys are needed beyond the public/private keys for each node.

Key generation, distribution, and revocation can be handled in larger deployments using a separate service like Ansible or Kubernetes Secrets.

Some services that help with key distribution and deployment:

- [https://pypi.org/project/wireguard-p2p/](https://pypi.org/project/wireguard-p2p/)
- [https://github.com/trailofbits/algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)
- [https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand)
- [https://github.com/its0x08/wg-install](https://github.com/its0x08/wg-install)
- [https://github.com/brittson/wireguard\_config\_maker](https://github.com/brittson/wireguard_config_maker)
- [https://www.wireguardconfig.com](https://www.wireguardconfig.com/)
- [https://github.com/UrielCh/wireguard](https://github.com/UrielCh/wireguard)

You can also read in keys from a file or via command if you don't want to hardcode them in `wg0.conf`, this makes managing keys via 3rd party service much easier:

```
[Interface]
...
PreUp = wg set %i private-key <(cat /some/path/%i/privkey)
```

Multiple servers should not share the same private key. WireGuard's protocol assumes distinct peers use distinct private keys, and reusing one can cause replay-related problems and involuntary endpoint roaming between those machines. See the [WireGuard whitepaper discussion of timestamp/replay behavior](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf). Most of the time, every peer should have its own public/private keypair so that peers can be individually identified and revoked.

## Usage

### QuickStart

Overview of the general process:

1. Install `apt install wireguard` or `pkg/brew install wireguard-tools` on each node
2. Generate public and private keys locally on each node `wg genkey` + `wg pubkey`
3. Create a `wg0.conf` WireGuard config file on the main relay server
	- `[Interface]` Make sure to specify the local tunnel address(es) the server will use, e.g. `Address = 192.0.2.1/24,2001:DB8::1/64` for a dual-stack VPN subnet
		- `[Peer]` Create a peer section for every client joining the VPN, using their corresponding remote public keys
4. Create a `wg0.conf` on each client node
	- `[Interface]` Make sure to specify only the client peer's own tunnel IPs when it doesn't relay traffic, e.g. `Address = 192.0.2.3/32,2001:DB8::3/128`.
		- `[Peer]` Create a peer section for each public peer not behind a NAT, and make sure to use IPv4 and/or IPv6 CIDRs as appropriate when defining what should route through that peer, e.g. relay server `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.0/24,2001:DB8::/64` or simple client `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.3/32,2001:DB8::3/128`.
5. Start WireGuard on the main relay server with `wg-quick up /full/path/to/wg0.conf`
6. Start WireGuard on all the client peers with `wg-quick up /full/path/to/wg0.conf`
7. Traffic is routed from peer to peer using most specific route first over the WireGuard interface, e.g. `ping 192.0.2.3` checks for a direct route to a peer with `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.3/32` first, then falls back to a relay server that's accepting IPs in the whole subnet

### Setup

```
# install on Ubuntu
sudo apt install wireguard

# install on macOS
brew install wireguard-tools

# install on FreeBSD
pkg install wireguard

# install on iOS/Android using Apple App Store/Google Play Store
# install on other systems using https://www.wireguard.com/install/#installation
```

ChromeOS note: some Chromebooks have basic built-in WireGuard support in the VPN settings UI, where you can add a connection and select `Provider type: WireGuard`. ChromeOS also documents `VPN.Type = WireGuard` in its ONC format for managed or imported network configs. Under the hood, ChromiumOS implements this as a built-in WireGuard client backed by the kernel module and documents a kernel `5.4+` requirement. See [Google's Chromebook VPN setup guide](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1282338?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwireguard-support), the [Chromium ONC spec](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/components/onc/docs/onc_spec.md#WireGuard-connections-and-types), and the [ChromiumOS VPN implementation notes](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/HEAD/shill/doc/vpn.md#built_in_wireguard_vpn).

## Config Reference

### Overview

WireGuard config is in [INI syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file), defined in a file usually called `wg0.conf`. It can be placed anywhere on the system, but is often placed in `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`.

The config path is specified as an argument when running any `wg-quick` command, e.g:  
`wg-quick up /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`

The config file name must be in the format `${name of the new WireGuard interface}.conf`. WireGuard interface names are typically prefixed with `wg` and numbered starting at `0`, but you can use any name that matches the regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_=+.-]{1,15}$`.

Config files can opt to use the limited set of `wg` config options, or the more extended `wg-quick` options, depending on what command is preferred to start WireGuard. These docs recommend sticking to `wg-quick` as it provides a more powerful and user-friendly config experience.

The core `wg(8)` config format covers peer/session state such as `PrivateKey`, `ListenPort`, `FwMark`, `PublicKey`, `PresharedKey`, `AllowedIPs`, `Endpoint`, and `PersistentKeepalive`. The convenience keys `Address`, `DNS`, `Table`, `MTU`, `PreUp`, `PostUp`, `PreDown`, and `PostDown` below are `wg-quick(8)` extensions. See [wg(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg.8.html) and [wg-quick(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg-quick.8.html).

### \[Interface\]

Defines the VPN settings for the local node.

**Examples**

- Node is a client that only routes traffic for itself and only exposes one IP
```
[Interface]
# Name = phone.example-vpn.dev
Address = 192.0.2.5/32
PrivateKey = <private key for phone.example-vpn.dev>
```
- Node is a public bounce server that can relay traffic to other peers and exposes route for entire VPN subnet
```
[Interface]
# Name = public-server1.example-vpn.tld
Address = 192.0.2.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = <private key for public-server1.example-vpn.tld>
DNS = 1.1.1.1
```

#### \# Name

This is just a standard comment in INI syntax used to help keep track of which config section belongs to which node, it's completely ignored by WireGuard and has no effect on VPN behavior.

NOTE: All comments, including `# Name`, are removed from the.conf files by certain operations and applications. If you need to identify peers, consider using a wireguard vanity key generator, such as [wireguard-vanity-keygen](https://github.com/axllent/wireguard-vanity-keygen) or [wireguard-vanity-address](https://github.com/warner/wireguard-vanity-address), which will allow you to include the host name in the public key of the host. The key generation can take minutes (4 characters), hours (5 characters) or longer, so consider using an abbreviation for hosts with longer names.

#### Address

Defines what address(es) the local WireGuard interface should use. Depending on whether the node is a simple client joining the VPN subnet, or a bounce server that's relaying traffic between multiple clients, this can be set to a single IP of the node itself (specified with CIDR notation), e.g. `192.0.2.3/32` or `2001:DB8::3/128`, or to multiple IPv4/IPv6 addresses on the same interface.

**Examples**

- Node is a client that only routes traffic for itself  
	`Address = 192.0.2.3/32`
- IPv6-only client address: `Address = 2001:DB8::3/128`
- Node is a public bounce server that can relay traffic to other peers  
	When the node is acting as the public bounce server, it should use an address inside the VPN subnet together with the subnet prefix length it routes, not just a `/32` for itself.

`Address = 192.0.2.1/24`

- Dual-stack example with both IPv4 and IPv6: `Address = 192.0.2.1/24,2001:DB8::1/64`

#### ListenPort

When the node is acting as a public bounce server, it should hardcode a port to listen for incoming VPN connections from the public internet. Clients that are not acting as relays usually do not need to set this value, but they still can if they want a fixed local UDP port.

**Examples**

- Using default WireGuard port  
	`ListenPort = 51820`
- Using custom WireGuard port  
	`ListenPort = 7000`

#### PrivateKey

This is the private key for the local node, never shared with other servers. All nodes must have a private key set, regardless of whether they are public bounce servers relaying traffic, or simple clients joining the VPN.

This key can be generated with `wg genkey > example.key`

**Examples**

`PrivateKey = somePrivateKeyAbcdAbcdAbcdAbcd=`

#### DNS

This is a `wg-quick` convenience option for the local machine, not a WireGuard setting that is announced or pushed to peers. In `wg-quick`, IP entries are applied as DNS servers for the local interface via `resolvconf`, and non-IP entries are treated as DNS search domains. See [wg-quick(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg-quick.8.html) and the [WireGuard for Windows parser](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows/tree/conf/parser.go).

**Examples**

- The value can be left unconfigured to use the system's default DNS handling
- A single DNS server can be provided: `DNS = 1.1.1.1`
- Multiple DNS servers can be provided: `DNS = 1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8`
- A DNS server and search domain can be provided: `DNS = 10.0.0.2, internal.example.com`

#### Table

Optionally defines which routing table to use for the WireGuard routes, not necessary to configure for most setups.

There are two special values: ‘off’ disables the creation of routes altogether, and ‘auto’ (the default) adds routes to the default table and enables special handling of default routes.

See [`wg-quick(8)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg-quick.8.html).

**Examples**

```
Table = 1234
```

#### MTU

Optionally defines the maximum transmission unit (MTU, aka packet/frame size) to use when connecting to the peer, not necessary to configure for most setups.

The MTU is automatically determined from the endpoint addresses or the system default route, which is usually a sane choice.

You should avoid setting this if at all possible. You almost certainly do not want 1500 here due to the encapsulation overhead.

See [`wg-quick(8)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg-quick.8.html).

**Examples**

```
MTU = 1420
```

#### PreUp

Optionally run a command before the interface is brought up. This option can be specified multiple times, with commands executed in the order they appear in the file.

**Examples**

- Add an IP route `PreUp = ip rule add ipproto tcp dport 22 table 1234`

#### PostUp

Optionally run a command after the interface is brought up. This option can appear multiple times, as with [PreUp](#PreUp)

**Examples**

- Read in a config value from a file or some command's output  
	`PostUp = wg set %i private-key <(some command here)`
- Log a line to a file  
	`PostUp = echo "$(date +%s) WireGuard Started" >> /var/log/wireguard.log`
- Hit a webhook on another server  
	`PostUp = curl https://events.example.dev/wireguard/started/?key=abcdefg`
- Add a route to the system routing table  
	`PostUp = ip rule add ipproto tcp dport 22 table 1234`
- Add an iptables rule to enable packet forwarding on the WireGuard interface  
	`PostUp   = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE`
- Configure `systemd-resolved` DNS settings for this interface `PostUp = resolvectl domain %i "~."; resolvectl dns %i 192.0.2.1; resolvectl dnssec %i yes`

#### PreDown

Optionally run a command before the interface is brought down. This option can appear multiple times, as with [PreUp](#PreUp)

**Examples**

- Log a line to a file  
	`PreDown = echo "$(date +%s) WireGuard Going Down" >> /var/log/wireguard.log`
- Hit a webhook on another server  
	`PreDown = curl https://events.example.dev/wireguard/stopping/?key=abcdefg`

#### PostDown

Optionally run a command after the interface is brought down. This option can appear multiple times, as with [PreUp](#PreUp)

**Examples**

- Log a line to a file  
	`PostDown = echo "$(date +%s) WireGuard Stopped" >> /var/log/wireguard.log`
- Hit a webhook on another server  
	`PostDown = curl https://events.example.dev/wireguard/stopped/?key=abcdefg`
- Remove the iptables rule that forwards packets on the WireGuard interface  
	`PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE`

### \[Peer\]

Defines the VPN settings for a remote peer capable of routing traffic for one or more addresses (itself and/or other peers). Peers can be either a public bounce server that relays traffic to other peers, or a directly accessible client via LAN/internet that is not behind a NAT and only routes traffic for itself.

In the simple relay topology used throughout this README, all clients are defined as peers on the public bounce server. Simple clients that only route traffic for themselves only need to define peers for the public relay and any other nodes that are directly reachable. Nodes behind separate NATs are usually not defined as peers of each other in this topology, because traffic between them is expected to go through the public relay instead. In that setup, NAT-ed nodes point their relay peer at a broader subnet such as `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.1/24` on the public server. Traffic destined for a NAT-ed peer that is not directly defined will match the relay server's broad `AllowedIPs` range, be encrypted to the relay server, and then be decrypted and re-encrypted by the relay for delivery to the final destination peer (see the [security note above](#how-public-relay-servers-work) about relay traffic not being end-to-end encrypted).

In summary, all nodes must be defined on the main bounce server. On client nodes, only peers that are directly accessible from a node should be defined as peers of that node, and any peers that must be relayed by a bounce server should be left out and handled by the relay server's catchall route.

In the configuration outlined in the docs below, a single server `public-server1` acts as the relay bounce server for a mix of publicly accessible and NAT-ed clients, and peers are configured on each node accordingly:

- **in `public-server1` `wg0.conf` (bounce server)**  
	`[peer]` list: `public-server2`, `home-server`, `laptop`, `phone`
- **in `public-server2` `wg0.conf` (simple public client)**  
	`[peer]` list: `public-server1`
- **in `home-server` `wg0.conf` (simple client behind NAT)**  
	`[peer]` list: `public-server1`, `public-server2`
- **in `laptop` `wg0.conf` (simple client behind NAT)**  
	`[peer]` list: `public-server1`, `public-server2`
- **in `phone` `wg0.conf` (simple client behind NAT)**  
	`[peer]` list: `public-server1`, `public-server2`

**Examples**

- Peer is a simple public client that only routes traffic for itself
```
[Peer]
# Name = public-server2.example-vpn.dev
Endpoint = public-server2.example-vpn.dev:51820
PublicKey = <public key for public-server2.example-vpn.dev>
AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.2/32
```
- Peer is a simple client behind a NAT that only routes traffic for itself
```
[Peer]
# Name = home-server.example-vpn.dev
PublicKey = <public key for home-server.example-vpn.dev>
AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.3/32
```
- Peer is a public bounce server that can relay traffic to other peers
```
[Peer]
# Name = public-server1.example-vpn.tld
Endpoint = public-server1.example-vpn.tld:51820
PublicKey = <public key for public-server1.example-vpn.tld>
# routes traffic to itself and entire subnet of peers as bounce server
AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.1/24
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

#### \# Name

This is just a standard comment in INI syntax used to help keep track of which config section belongs to which node, it's completely ignored by WireGuard and has no effect on VPN behavior.

#### Endpoint

Defines the publicly accessible address for a remote peer. This should be left out for peers behind a NAT or peers that don't have a stable publicly accessible IP:PORT pair. Typically, this only needs to be defined on the main bounce server, but it can also be defined on other public nodes with stable IPs like `public-server2` in the example config below. IPv6 literal endpoints are supported, but they must be wrapped in square brackets. After a packet is received from a peer, WireGuard also updates the stored endpoint to that peer's most recent authenticated source IP:PORT.

**Examples**

- Endpoint is an IP address  
	`Endpoint = 123.124.125.126:51820` (IPv6 is also supported)
- Endpoint is an IPv6 address: `Endpoint = [2001:DB8::1]:51820`
- Endpoint is a hostname/FQDN  
	`Endpoint = public-server1.example-vpn.tld:51820`

#### AllowedIPs

This defines which IP prefixes the local node associates with a peer in WireGuard's cryptokey routing table. When sending, the local node uses the destination IP to choose which peer to encrypt to. When receiving, it only accepts a decrypted packet from that peer if the packet's source IP matches one of that peer's `AllowedIPs`. This mapping is local to the machine that owns the config; it is not dynamically advertised to other peers. See [WireGuard's cryptokey routing overview](https://www.wireguard.com/) and the [WireGuard whitepaper](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf).

On simple clients, this is usually a single address (the VPN address of the peer itself) or a small routed prefix. On bounce servers, this may be a broader range of IPs or subnets that should be routed back to that peer. Multiple IPs and subnets may be specified using comma-separated IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR notation (from a single /32 or /128 address, all the way up to `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` to indicate a default route to send all internet and VPN traffic through that peer). If you need "internet passthrough but no peer-to-peer access", treat `AllowedIPs` as address mapping and source validation, and enforce any additional forwarding policy separately on the machine that would route the traffic.

When deciding how to route a packet, the system chooses the most specific route first, and falls back to broader routes. So for a packet destined to `192.0.2.3`, the system would first look for a peer configured with `192.0.2.3/32` specifically, and would fall back to a peer configured with `192.0.2.1/24` or a larger range like `0.0.0.0/0` as a last resort.

**Examples**

- peer is a simple client that only represents its own tunnel IP: `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.3/32`
- peer is a simple client with an IPv6 tunnel address: `AllowedIPs = 2001:DB8::3/128`
- peer is a relay server that can bounce VPN traffic to all other peers `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.1/24`
- peer is a relay server for a dual-stack VPN subnet: `AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.0/24,2001:DB8::/64`
- peer is a relay server that bounces all internet & VPN traffic (like a proxy), including IPv6  
	`AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0,::/0`
- peer is a relay server that routes to itself and only one other peer  
	`AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.3/32,192.0.2.4/32`
- peer is a relay server that routes to itself and all nodes on its local LAN  
	`AllowedIPs = 192.0.2.3/32,192.168.1.1/24`

#### PublicKey

This is the public key for the remote node, shareable with all peers. All nodes must have a public key set, regardless of whether they are public bounce servers relaying traffic, or simple clients joining the VPN.

This key can be generated with `wg pubkey < example.key > example.key.pub`. (see above for how to generate the private key `example.key`)

**Examples**

`PublicKey = somePublicKeyAbcdAbcdAbcdAbcd=`

#### PersistentKeepalive

If the connection is going from a NAT-ed peer to a public peer, the node behind the NAT must regularly send an outgoing keepalive packet in order to keep the bidirectional connection alive in the NAT router's connection table.

**Examples**

- local public node to remote public node  
	This value should be left undefined as persistent pings are not needed.
- local public node to remote NAT-ed node  
	This value should be left undefined as it's the client's responsibility to keep the connection alive because the server cannot reopen a dead connection to the client if it times out.
- local NAT-ed node to remote public node  
	`PersistentKeepalive = 25` this will send an authenticated empty keepalive packet every 25 seconds, keeping the connection open in the local NAT router's connection table.

## Advanced Topics

### IPv6

The examples in these docs primarily use IPv4, but WireGuard is layer-3 only and natively supports both IPv4 and IPv6, including v4-in-v6 and v6-in-v4. In practice, the important patterns are:

- `Address` accepts IPv6 interface addresses such as `2001:DB8::3/128`
- `AllowedIPs` accepts IPv6 CIDRs such as `2001:DB8::/64` and the IPv6 default route `::/0`
- `Endpoint` accepts IPv6 literals, but they must be wrapped in square brackets, e.g. `[2001:DB8::1]:51820`
- the `proxy_arp` line shown in the Setup section is IPv4-specific; IPv6 forwarding uses `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1`

See the [WireGuard whitepaper](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf), [`wg(8)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg.8.html), and [`wg-quick(8)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wg-quick.8.html).

**Example**

```
[Interface]
Address = 192.0.2.3/32, 2001:DB8::3/128

[Peer]
...
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
```

### Forwarding All Traffic

If you want to forward *all* internet traffic through the VPN, and not just use it as a server-to-server subnet, you can add `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0` to the `AllowedIPs` definition of the peer you want to pipe your traffic through.

If the client also has IPv6 connectivity and you want *all* traffic to go through the VPN, include the IPv6 catchall `::/0` too. Otherwise, IPv6 traffic can still bypass the tunnel even if IPv4 is routed through it.

**Example**

```
[Interface]
# Name = phone.example-vpn.dev
Address = 192.0.2.3/32
PrivateKey = <private key for phone.example-vpn.dev>

[Peer]
# Name = public-server1.example-vpn.dev
PublicKey = <public key for public-server1.example-vpn.dev>
Endpoint = public-server1.example-vpn.dev:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
```

### NAT To NAT Connections

Plain WireGuard configs can sometimes make direct connections between two clients behind NATs without the need for a public relay server, but there is no built-in signaling or discovery layer to find the right public IP:PORT pair automatically. In practice, manual NAT-to-NAT setups only work when the peers already know usable public IP:PORT information ahead of time, or when an external signaling/discovery tool provides it.

A known port and address need to be configured ahead of time for the static/manual approach described here. WebRTC is an example of a protocol that can dynamically configure a connection between two NATs, but it does this by using an out-of-band signaling server to detect the IP:PORT combo of each host. WireGuard itself doesn't do that, so the plain `wg` / `wg-quick` setup below only works with a hardcoded `Endpoint` + `ListenPort` (and `PersistentKeepalive` so it doesn't drop after inactivity).

See the official [wireguard-tools `nat-hole-punching` example](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/tree/contrib/nat-hole-punching/) for a manual setup.

#### Requirements for NAT-to-NAT setups

- For the static/manual approach, at least one peer has to have a usable `Endpoint` that can be configured ahead of time. If neither side has one, you'll need an external discovery/signaling solution or a relay server
- At least one peer has to have a hardcoded UDP `ListenPort` defined, and its NAT router must not do UDP source port randomization, otherwise return packets will be sent to the hardcoded `ListenPort` and dropped by the router instead of using the random port assigned by the NAT on the outgoing packet
- All NAT'ed peers must have `PersistentKeepalive` enabled on all other peers, so that they continually send outgoing keepalive packets to keep connections persisted in their NAT's routing table

#### The hole-punching connection process

1. Peer1 sends a UDP packet to Peer2, it's rejected by Peer2's NAT router immediately, but that's ok, the only purpose was to get Peer1's NAT to start forwarding any expected UDP responses back to Peer1 behind its NAT
2. Peer2 sends a UDP packet to Peer1, it's accepted and forwarded to Peer1 as Peer1's NAT server is already expecting responses from Peer2 because of the initial outgoing packet
3. Peer1 sends a UDP response to Peer2's packet, it's accepted and forwarded by Peer2's NAT server as it's also expecting responses because of the initial outgoing packet

This process of sending an initial packet that gets rejected, then using the fact that the router has now created a forwarding rule to accept responses is called "UDP hole-punching".

When you send a UDP packet out, the router (usually) creates a temporary rule mapping your source address and port to the destination address and port, and vice versa. UDP packets returning from the destination address and port (and no other) are passed through to the original source address and port (and no other). This is how most UDP applications function behind NATs (e.g. BitTorrent, Skype, etc). This rule will timeout after some minutes of inactivity, so the client behind the NAT must send regular outgoing packets to keep it open (see `PersistentKeepalive`).

Getting this to work when both end-points are behind NATs or firewalls requires that both end-points send packets to each-other at about the same time. This means that both sides need to know each-other's public IP addresses and port numbers ahead of time, in WireGuard's case this is achieved by hard-coding pre-defined ports for both sides in `wg0.conf`.

#### Drawbacks and limitations

Many of the older hole-punching methods described in old blog posts are no longer effective on modern networks. One example was a novel method pioneered by [pwnat](https://github.com/samyk/pwnat) that faked an ICMP Time Exceeded response from outside the NAT to get a packet back through to a NAT'ed peer, thereby leaking its own source port. Hardcoding UDP ports and public IPs for both sides of a NAT-to-NAT connection (as described above) still works on a small percentage of networks. Generally the more "enterprisey" a network is, the less likely you'll be able to hole punch public UDP ports (commercial public Wi-Fi and cell data NATs often don't work for example).

##### Source port randomization

The static/manual approach described here is generally not possible if all endpoints are behind NATs with strict UDP source port randomization (for example, many cellular data networks). Since neither side is able to hardcode a `ListenPort` and guarantee that its NAT will accept traffic on that port after the outgoing packet, you cannot coordinate a port for the initial hole-punch between peers and the connection will fail. For this reason, phone-to-phone connections on LTE/3G are usually not feasible with this simple approach, but phone-to-office or phone-to-home may still work when the office or home has a stable public IP and doesn't do source port randomization.

##### Using a signaling server

A signaling server can improve the odds by telling each side the other's current public IP:PORT tuple, but it still depends on the NAT behavior of both networks. The official [wireguard-tools `nat-hole-punching` example](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/tree/contrib/nat-hole-punching/) demonstrates the basic approach.

##### Dynamic IP addresses

If a peer's public IP changes, WireGuard can learn the new endpoint from authenticated packets sent by that peer, but DNS hostnames are not continuously polled in the background. If you depend on Dynamic DNS `Endpoint` hostnames being refreshed proactively, you may need external tooling; the official wireguard-tools repo includes [`reresolve-dns.sh`](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/tree/contrib/reresolve-dns/) for exactly this purpose.

#### Testing it out

You can see if a hole-punching setup is feasible by using netcat on the client and server to see what ports and connection order work to get a bidirectional connection open: run `nc -v -u -p 51820 <address of peer2> 51820` (on peer1) and `nc -v -u -l 0.0.0.0 51820` (on peer2), then type in both windows to see if you can get bidirectional traffic going. If it doesn't work regardless of which peer sends the initial packet, then WireGuard will be unable to work between the peers without a public relay server.
