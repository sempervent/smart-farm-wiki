# AGENTS.md — Operating contract

This file is the **highest-priority behavioral contract** for any automated or human agent working in this repository. When instructions conflict, **follow this document first**, then `README.md`, then task-specific prompts.

---

## Mission

This repository implements an **LLM-maintained markdown wiki**: a persistent, compounding knowledge base where:

- **`raw/`** holds **immutable** source material (notes, imports, excerpts, files).
- **`wiki/`** holds the **agent-authored synthesis** (business plan packages, entities, concepts, timelines, glossary, analyses, **procedural guides** in `analyses/` via `page_subtype`, cross-links).
- **`docs/`** holds the **operator handbook** for humans and agents (read in-repo); it explains *how* the system works, not the domain knowledge itself. (In this fork, the **MkDocs site** is built from **`wiki/`** only; see `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/operations/publishing.md`.)

The **mechanical goal** is **deterministic, inspectable, markdown-first** workflows: plain files, clear paths, validation scripts, and reproducible doc builds.

### Domain mission and prose (Smart Farm Wiki)

**Why not duplicate long mission prose here:** `AGENTS.md` must stay a **short, stable contract**—rules agents load every session. **Mission statements, audience, values, and voice** belong in the wiki so they **version with synthesis**, appear on the **published site**, and can evolve without bloating the contract file.

**Canonical page:** [`wiki/concepts/smart-farm-wiki-mission-and-values.md`](wiki/concepts/smart-farm-wiki-mission-and-values.md) — mission, vision, audience, authoring values, and voice. Agents shaping **tone** or **scope** for new pages should read it alongside [`wiki/overview.md`](wiki/overview.md).

**Reasoning summary:** Separation keeps **behavioral law** (this file) distinct from **intellectual purpose** (wiki)—reducing merge conflict on policy vs prose, and keeping “what we believe about small-scale ag and appropriate technology” **editable by the same ingest/query workflow** as other concepts.

## Layer definitions

| Layer | Purpose | Mutable by agent? |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `raw/` | Provenance-grounded sources (markdown imports, **PDFs**, and other files); inbox → processed pipeline | **Append / file new sources only. Never edit processed or alter meaning of stored sources.** |
| `wiki/` | Structured knowledge pages, index, log | **Yes**, following rules below |
| `docs/` | Template handbook, architecture, workflows (MkDocs) | **Yes**, when improving operator documentation |
| `scripts/` | Validation and scaffolding | **Yes**, with tests and clear CLI contracts |
| `examples/` | Small worked examples (isolated from production paths) | **Yes**, keep realistic but minimal |

**Do not** treat `examples/` as the live wiki unless the user explicitly asks to promote content.

---

## File ownership model

- **Human or policy owner**: `AGENTS.md`, licensing, and high-level conventions. Agents may propose edits via PRs or patches; destructive convention changes require explicit intent.
- **Agent maintainer**: `wiki/**/*.md` (except obey immutability rules for any symlinked content), `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`.
- **Build / CI**: `.github/workflows/*`, `mkdocs.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`.
- **Raw corpus**: files under `raw/processed/` are **write-once** after processing; `raw/inbox/` accepts new drops.

---

## Mandatory workflows

### Ingest

1. Add or confirm raw material under `raw/inbox/` (or processed pipeline per `docs/workflows/ingest.md`).
   - **PDFs** are first-class sources: move each to `raw/processed/...` under a stable **kebab-case** basename, run `uv run python scripts/pdf_to_markdown.py <path-to.pdf>` (or `--all-raw`) so a sibling **`*-extracted.md`** machine extract exists; the **PDF remains canonical** for figures and layout. Source-notes for PDFs must cite **both** the `.pdf` and the `*-extracted.md` in the body (and `source_ids` includes the `.pdf` path). See `docs/workflows/ingest.md` and `scripts/validate_raw_pdf_links.py` / `validate_wiki.py --raw-pdf-links` when the full corpus is local.
2. Create or update **`source-notes`** in `wiki/source-notes/` pointing to stable `raw/` paths.
3. Update relevant entity/concept/topic pages; add cross-links.
4. **Append** `wiki/log.md` with `ingest` entry (see Log format).
5. **Update** `wiki/index.md` if new pages were added or titles changed.
6. Run `uv run python scripts/validate_wiki.py` before commit.

### Query

1. Answer from `wiki/` + cited `raw/` paths; do not invent provenance.
2. If the answer should persist, **create or update** a durable wiki page (often `analyses/` or `concepts/`) and link it from `index.md` when appropriate.
3. **Append** `wiki/log.md` with `query` entry summarizing the question and where the answer lives.

### Lint

Periodic hygiene: link integrity, orphan reduction, stale-claim review, duplicate title checks, index alignment.

1. Run `uv run python scripts/validate_wiki.py` (use `--strict` in CI).
2. Fix or ticket broken links; add missing index entries for intentional pages.
3. **Append** `wiki/log.md` with `lint` entry.

---

## Maintaining `wiki/index.md`

- `index.md` is the **catalog and navigation surface** agents should read first.
- Organize by **page category** (overview, **business plan packages**, entities, concepts, topics, source-notes, analyses, comparisons, timelines, glossary). For **themed** entry points without splitting the full analyses list, link **[`wiki/topics/wiki-navigation-and-structural-hubs.md`](wiki/topics/wiki-navigation-and-structural-hubs.md)** from the overview or analyses intro.
- Each entry: **relative link** + **one-line description**.
- After adding/removing/renaming pages, update `index.md`. Run `uv run python scripts/rebuild_index.py` to compare index links to files on disk.

---

## Maintaining `wiki/log.md`

- **Append-only**: never rewrite or delete historical entries.
- New entries go **below** prior content unless the user explicitly migrates format (then log the migration in a new `policy` entry).
- Heading format (required):

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Short source or batch title
## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | Short question summary
## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | What was checked
## [YYYY-MM-DD] refactor | Scope of reorganization
## [YYYY-MM-DD] policy | Convention or AGENTS change
```

- Body: bullet summary of actions, files touched, and pointers to durable pages.

---

## Page taxonomy

Standard directories under `wiki/`:

| `page_type` | Typical path | Role |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| `overview` | `overview.md` | North-star summary of the wiki’s domain |
| `source_note` | `source-notes/` | Grounding note for a raw source |
| `entity` | `entities/` | Named subject (person, org, product, paper) |
| `concept` | `concepts/` | Idea or term of art |
| `topic` | `topics/` | Thematic bucket spanning entities/concepts |
| `analysis` | `analyses/` | Argument, evaluation, synthesis, **or** procedure-shaped pages (runbooks, how-tos) that remain here for validation/tooling consistency |
| `comparison` | `comparisons/` | Structured A vs B |
| `timeline` | `timelines/` | Chronology |
| `glossary` | `glossary/` | Definition-first entries |
| `operating_doc` | (rare; or root) | How the repo itself is operated |

**Business plan packages** (`wiki/business-plan/`): **first-class** navigation pages for a **named** business plan (e.g. East Tennessee two-site). They **do not replace** analysis chapters in `analyses/`—they provide a **stable spine** (reading order, artifact tables, links to critique and repo wiring). Use `page_type: topic` unless a dedicated type is introduced later.

### Analysis subtypes and guide-shaped pages (`page_subtype`)

Procedure runbooks, stepwise operator guides, and **standards** often live under `analyses/` because they share the same validation rules as other syntheses. To make them **first-class in metadata** without splitting directories, use optional YAML:

| `page_subtype` | Typical content | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| *(omitted)* | Default analysis | Essay, audit, synthesis, matrix—no implied procedure. |
| `operational_guide` | Checklist / sequence runbooks (e.g. Pi k3s provisioning **hub** + child sequence pages) | Opening section should state **mandatory** vs **optional HA** steps when applicable. |
| `standard` | Operator **norms** (hostnames, iSCSI, roles)—short durable bar | Pair with **`operational_maturity`** when the standard has been exercised on real infra. |
| `meta_audit` | IA / repository / ownership audits | Distinct from domain “essay” analyses; links **hubs**, does not replace them. |
| `query_synthesis` | Time-stamped answers to ad-hoc questions | If doctrine becomes permanent, **fold** into a canonical page and add routing. |

**Standards** may also be `topic` pages when they are purely narrative; use `page_type: analysis` + `page_subtype: standard` when the page is checklist-heavy and validated like other analyses.

### Guides vs runbooks vs standards (within `analyses/`)

Procedural content stays under **`wiki/analyses/`** for validation and MkDocs consistency. Distinctions are **semantic** (reader intent), not separate directories:

| Reader intent | Metadata / convention |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **Standard** (norms) | `page_subtype: standard` — short **bars**; link out to guides for full sequences |
| **Guide** (how-to, drill, doctrine spine with operator routing) | `page_subtype: operational_guide` |
| **Runbook** (incident / degraded mode) | `operational_guide` + prefer **`runbook-*.md`** filename (or **Runbook —** title) |
| **Essay / audit** | Default analysis (`page_subtype` omitted or `meta_audit` / `query_synthesis`) |

**Package strategy** (where they live, maturity labels, linking to architecture and entities): [`wiki/topics/procedural-guides-package-strategy-smart-farm-wiki.md`](wiki/topics/procedural-guides-package-strategy-smart-farm-wiki.md).

---

## Naming conventions

- **Filenames**: `kebab-case.md` exclusively.
- **Titles**: Sentence case or title case — **one canonical title per page** in `title` frontmatter.
- **Stability**: Prefer renaming by adding `aliases` frontmatter and updating links; avoid churn.

---

## Linking conventions

- Use **relative Markdown links** only: `[text](../concepts/foo.md)` not absolute repo paths.
- **Obsidian**: `[[wiki links]]` optional; portable links must still exist as `.md` relatives for MkDocs-oriented tooling.
- **Wikilinks**: If you use `[[...]]`, ensure a parallel `.md` relative link exists for non-Obsidian consumers (CI may optionally enforce this later).

---

## Citation conventions

- When a claim depends on a raw source, cite **stable path + optional excerpt id**:

```markdown
See [raw/processed/2026/example.md](../../raw/processed/2026/example.md) — section “Key finding”.
```

- Prefer `source_ids` in frontmatter for machine-checkable linkage.

---

## Public corpus vs private or sensitive material

- **`raw/`** may be **large, local-only, or gitignored**; CI and clones may not have every file. **Do not** treat missing `raw/` targets in validation as permission to weaken provenance in the wiki—keep stable paths, and run `validate_wiki.py --raw-pdf-links` when the full corpus is present.
- **MkDocs** publishes **`wiki/`** as the public-facing site; **`docs/`** is the operator handbook. Paths under `raw/` in wiki markdown are **neutralized** in HTML builds so public readers do not get **broken navigable links** to files that are not shipped—see `docs/operations/raw-corpus-and-publishing.md`. **Obsidian** authors may still open `raw/` locally.
- **Secrets and operational security**: Do not commit **passwords, keys, hostnames, or internal IPs** into `wiki/` or `raw/` unless policy explicitly allows and rotation is understood. Prefer **placeholders** (`BROKER_LABEL`, `SITE_FARM`) in published pages and keep **site-specific truth** in **private** runbooks or encrypted stores outside the repo.

---

## Canonicalization before proliferation

- Before adding a **new** analysis or topic page, search **`wiki/index.md`**, **`wiki/analyses/domain-content-overview.md`**, and the relevant **topic hub** (e.g. [`wiki/topics/two-site-smart-farm-operations.md`](wiki/topics/two-site-smart-farm-operations.md)) for an existing **canonical** page (business-plan core, reference architecture, runbook parent).
- **Extend** the canonical page with a dated subsection, a table row, or a “See also” block rather than spawning a **parallel essay** that overlaps scope. If overlap is unavoidable, add **`supersedes` / `superseded_by`** (or explicit “routing” sections pointing to the canonical home) and log the decision in `wiki/log.md`.
- Meta and repository-structure audits belong in **`analyses/`** with clear titles; they should **link** to domain hubs rather than replacing them.

### Operational and guide-shaped content

- **One procedure owner per subject cluster** (e.g. Pi k3s: strategy page + one guide hub linking sequence pages). New checklists should attach to that hub or justify a new `page_subtype: operational_guide` scope in `wiki/log.md`.
- **Standards** (short norms) **vs** **guides** (long sequences): prefer a standard page + guide hub pair over two guides with duplicated outlines.
- **First-class guides**: treat procedural pages as durable products—tag **`operational_maturity`**, link **standards** + **entities** + **architecture**, and follow the **package strategy** page above.
- Use [`wiki/topics/wiki-navigation-and-structural-hubs.md`](wiki/topics/wiki-navigation-and-structural-hubs.md) when `index.md` feels too flat—do **not** duplicate the full analysis list there.

---

## Entity-first rule (persistent real-world subjects)

- **Named products**, **organizations**, **operating sites** (homestead vs production parcel **roles**), **infrastructure systems** (water, power, field telemetry as a stack), **breeds**, **regulated agencies**, and **major software projects** that appear in multiple pages should eventually have an **`entities/`** page: one **canonical title**, `page_type: entity`, short **scope** (what the page is for), and links **out** to concepts, comparisons, and source-notes. Site entities use **planning labels** (`SITE_HOME`, `SITE_FARM`) and **do not** assert uncommitted parcel facts.
- **Concepts** remain for **ideas** (e.g. “LoRaWAN” as technology); **entities** are for **specific** things (e.g. a particular **open-source project** or **company**) when the vault needs stable cross-links and index entries.
- Until an entity exists, link to **source-notes** and **topics**; add the entity when the third or fourth page would duplicate the same introduction text.

---

## Hub maintenance

- **Topic hubs** and **`wiki/index.md`** are **routing contracts**: when you add a sibling page (new runbook, comparison, or business-plan chapter), update the **hub table** or index section so the new page is **discoverable** without relying on search alone.
- **Strategic-audit** and **implementation-backlog** pages are **maps**, not substitutes for hubs—keep **`domain-content-overview`** and topic hubs aligned when navigation changes.

---

## Page ownership (canonical subjects)

- A **canonical page** **owns** durable scope for a **cluster** (business plan package + framework, reference architecture + SoR + field telemetry, validation stack, two-site operating model). **Major** additions to the subject should land **there** first, or in a clearly scoped **child** analysis that **links upward** in the opening section.
- **Analyses** that only **support** a canonical page (runbooks, pilots, query syntheses) should **not** copy the canonical page’s **outline**; add a **Routing** paragraph if overlap could confuse readers.
- **Ownership map** (clusters, risks, entity backlog): [`wiki/analyses/structural-audit-page-ownership-entity-gaps-and-hub-routing.md`](wiki/analyses/structural-audit-page-ownership-entity-gaps-and-hub-routing.md). Update that audit when **ownership** or **merge** decisions change materially—log significant changes in `wiki/log.md`.
- **Agritourism vs production-led** scenarios are **different** products; cross-link as **alternates**, do not merge without explicit `supersedes` and human intent.

---

## Claim strength and source authority

- Prefer **authoritative** sources for upgradable claims: **Extension**, **USDA / NRCS**, **land-grant** publications, **peer-reviewed** work, vendor **primary documentation**, and **standards** (ITU, IEEE, RFC). Label **forums, blogs, and chat exports** as **anecdotal** unless corroborated.
- Use frontmatter **`confidence`** and **`review_status`** honestly. When mixing strong and weak sources on one page, **separate** them visually (subsections or tables). **Do not** upgrade **“might”** to **“does”** without a cited source or a labeled assumption.
- **Regulatory and safety** claims (food safety, animal health, electrical work) require **explicit** sourcing or **deferral** to professionals—see [`wiki/concepts/smart-farm-wiki-mission-and-values.md`](wiki/concepts/smart-farm-wiki-mission-and-values.md).

---

## Frontmatter schema

Optional YAML frontmatter is encouraged. Common fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `title` | Display title (should match index) |
| `page_type` | One of the taxonomy types |
| `page_subtype` | Optional; see **Analysis subtypes** (e.g. `operational_guide`, `standard`, `meta_audit`, `query_synthesis`) |
| `status` | `draft` \| `active` \| `deprecated` — **repository / editorial lifecycle** for the page |
| `operational_maturity` | Optional; **`draft`** \| **`pilot_ready`** \| **`field_tested`** \| **`superseded`** — **how** **much** **real-world** **exercise** **the** **procedure** **has** **had** (orthogonal to `status`) |
| `created` | ISO date |
| `updated` | ISO date |
| `source_count` | Integer (optional) |
| `source_ids` | List of stable ids or raw paths |
| `aliases` | Alternate titles |
| `tags` | List of short tokens |
| `supersedes` / `superseded_by` | For deprecation chains |
| `confidence` | `low` \| `medium` \| `high` (epistemic) |
| `review_status` | `unreviewed` \| `reviewed` \| `stale` |

**Rules**:

- `wiki/overview.md`, entity/concept/analysis/comparison/timeline pages: **must** include `title` and `page_type` for validation.
- `wiki/log.md` and `wiki/index.md`: **no** required frontmatter.

**Operational maturity (optional)**:

- Use **`operational_maturity`** on **runbooks**, **standards**, and **guide hubs** where **deployment history** matters to readers.
- **`draft`**: structure present; not yet validated against live systems.
- **`pilot_ready`**: exercised in lab or constrained pilot; limitations documented.
- **`field_tested`**: used on real farm/homelab edge under stated constraints; drills or incidents inform updates.
- **`superseded`**: routing preserved for links; must pair with **`superseded_by`** (or explicit successor section) when replacing procedure content.
- Do **not** conflate with **`review_status`** (editorial review) or **`confidence`** (source epistemics).

---

## Conflict and contradiction handling

- **Do not silently overwrite** competing claims. Prefer:
  - same page: add dated subsection with evidence and confidence; or
  - split: new analysis page with `supersedes` linkage.
- Call out unresolved tension explicitly; log significant merges in `log.md`.

---

## Stale-claim handling

- Mark uncertain or dated material with `review_status: stale` or a visible callout.
- Prefer incremental updates; if replacing, use `superseded_by` and keep a short redirect note in the old page body.

---

## Orphan page handling

- A page is **orphan** if no other wiki page links to it **and** it is not listed in `index.md`. Validation reports orphans; fix by adding inbound links or index entries.

---

## Proposing new pages

1. Pick `page_type` and path per taxonomy.
2. Copy from `templates/` using `uv run python scripts/scaffold_page.py`.
3. Fill frontmatter, write minimal viable content, cross-link, update `index.md`, append `log.md`.

---

## Filing answers back into the wiki

- Ephemeral chat answers → durable **`analyses/`** or **`concepts/`** page when reuse is likely.
- Include **question context**, **answer summary**, **links** to sources and related wiki pages.
- Log under `query` with pointer to the new page.

---

## Incremental maintenance

- **Prefer small, frequent edits** over full rewrites.
- When refactoring, batch by theme; log under `refactor`.
- Reserve large-scale reorg for explicit user approval.

---

## Raw sources are immutable

- **Never** edit files in `raw/processed/` except **append-only** logs if a dedicated log file exists and policy allows.
- Corrections belong in **wiki** or new raw notes with clear provenance, not silent fixes to archived sources.

---

## Log is append-only history

- Do not delete or rewrite past `## [...]` entries in `wiki/log.md`.
- Typo fixes: only if they do not change meaning; prefer a new correction entry.

---

## Preserving user intent and provenance

- Follow explicit user instructions for scope and tone.
- When summarizing sources, preserve distinctions the user cares about.
- Prefer quoting short phrases from raw over paraphrase when ambiguity is high.

---

## Relative links for Obsidian and MkDocs

- Wiki links must work when opened as a folder vault in Obsidian **and** when processed by static analyzers.
- Avoid spaces in filenames; use `kebab-case.md`.
- For assets, prefer `raw/assets/` or documented attachment paths in `docs/operations/obsidian.md`.

---

## Agent session checklist

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this file) and `wiki/index.md`. For **navigation / IA** context, see [`wiki/topics/wiki-navigation-and-structural-hubs.md`](wiki/topics/wiki-navigation-and-structural-hubs.md) and [`wiki/analyses/structural-debt-audit-wiki-ia-and-operational-maturity.md`](wiki/analyses/structural-debt-audit-wiki-ia-and-operational-maturity.md). For **procedural how-tos and runbooks**, see [`wiki/topics/procedural-guides-package-strategy-smart-farm-wiki.md`](wiki/topics/procedural-guides-package-strategy-smart-farm-wiki.md). When authoring substantive **domain** synthesis, also read [`wiki/concepts/smart-farm-wiki-mission-and-values.md`](wiki/concepts/smart-farm-wiki-mission-and-values.md) for mission, audience, and voice alignment. Before creating **new** parallel analyses, apply **Canonicalization before proliferation**, check topic hubs, and consult [`wiki/analyses/structural-audit-page-ownership-entity-gaps-and-hub-routing.md`](wiki/analyses/structural-audit-page-ownership-entity-gaps-and-hub-routing.md) for **cluster ownership**.
2. Identify layer: raw vs wiki vs docs change.
3. Run `uv run python scripts/validate_wiki.py` before and after substantive edits.
4. Update `wiki/index.md` when navigation should change.
5. Append `wiki/log.md` for ingest/query/lint/refactor/policy work.
6. Keep commits scoped and messages descriptive.

---

## Definition of done

| Task | Done when |
|------|-----------|
| **Ingest** | Raw filed (for **PDFs**: sibling `*-extracted.md` + source-note cites both); source-notes + synthesis updated; log + index updated; validator passes; run `--raw-pdf-links` when the full `raw/` corpus is present locally |
| **Query** | Answer cites wiki/raw; durable page created/updated if needed; log appended |
| **Lint** | Validator clean (`--strict` in CI); orphans/titles addressed or explicitly deferred in log; hubs/index aligned after navigation changes (see **Hub maintenance**) |

---

## Scripts reference

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| `scripts/bootstrap.py` | Create missing dirs/files; optional rename placeholders |
| `scripts/validate_wiki.py` | Repository integrity checks; links under `raw/` need not resolve by default (corpus may be uncommitted); optional `--raw-pdf-links` with `--strict` when validating a full local corpus |
| `scripts/validate_raw_pdf_links.py` | PDF ↔ `*-extracted.md` pairing, wiki links into `raw/`, PDF source-note extract links; **default** warns on missing local files; **`--strict`** fails (public CI uses non-strict via pytest). Public MkDocs build neutralizes `raw/` links in HTML — see `docs/operations/raw-corpus-and-publishing.md` |
| `scripts/rebuild_index.py` | Audit or regenerate index sections |
| `scripts/append_log.py` | Append a correctly formatted log entry |
| `scripts/scaffold_page.py` | New page from `templates/` |
| `scripts/pdf_to_markdown.py` | PDF text → `*-extracted.md` beside the file (PyMuPDF; not OCR) |

---

## Non-goals

- Opaque databases, proprietary formats, or undocumented codegen as the source of truth.
- Turning `wiki/` into an unbounded dump without structure.

When uncertain, **add a note in the wiki**, **cite raw**, and **log the decision**.
